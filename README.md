# Quadratic-Teacher
Module to train Quadratic Equation Factoring.

Allow users to generate random Quadratic Equations questions (to be factored) or varying difficulties in 3 separate training formats.

SANDBOX:
Unlimited random questions for practicing

QUIZ:
A set of 10 questions to test user's skills

UNLIMITED:
Unlimited questions with a tracker of consecutive correct answers

Each format has a slider for difficulty to increase the constants in the questions.
The module is designed to allow extra spaces, writing "1" or leaving that space blank, along with many other possible methods of answering it right.

Future implementation includes adding a timer for a timed format. Current module is to train for accuracy over speed.
