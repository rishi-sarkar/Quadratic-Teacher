# Quadratic Teacher

**Quadratic Teacher** is a software program to help you practice and become more comfortable with factoring quadratic equations. It is a free and unique way to enjoy and learn about quadratics. The application presents multiple modes and difficulty levels to allow you to practice at your own pace and challenge yourself.

## Features

- **Sandbox**  
  Unlimited random questions for practicing factoring skills.  
  Move the difficulty slider to increase the magnitude of the coefficients.

- **Quiz**  
  A set of 10 questions at a time to test your skills.  
  Displays your current and final score out of 10.

- **Unlimited**  
  Unlimited questions with a tracker of consecutive correct answers.  
  Keep playing until you get one wrong, and track your high score.

Each format has a difficulty level (shown on the right side of the interface) that you can adjust to generate more complex quadratics. The module is designed to be flexible with your answer entry—extra spaces or omitting the coefficient `1` (e.g., `(x+2)` vs. `(1x+2)`) are accepted.
